A simple Telegram Bot made to test Python skills.

It has several functions:

1. Throw a random fact.
2. A classic ChatGPT interaction. Mostly in correspondence.
3. A dialog simulation with a famous person.
4. Quiz.
5. Tranlastor. The following languages: English, Deutch, Italian, French, Spanish

The bot requires a 'credentials.py' file in which a ChatGPT Token and a Telegram token should be listed under the variables ChatGPT_TOKEN and BOT_TOKEN, respectively. 
You can create the file manually or use the one from the repository. Don't forget to paste your token in this case then.
